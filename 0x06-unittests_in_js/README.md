# 0x06. Unittests in JS

Welcome to the **0x06. Unittests in JS** project! This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on learning unit testing in JavaScript using tools like Mocha, Chai, and Sinon.

## Project Details

- **Author:** Johann Kerbrat
- **Position:** Engineering Manager at Uber Works
- **Weight:** 1
- **Start Date:** August 23, 2023 6:00 AM
- **End Date:** August 25, 2023 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release Date:** August 23, 2023 6:00 PM
- **Auto Review:** An auto review will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use Mocha to write a test suite
- Utilize different assertion libraries such as Node or Chai
- Manage and present long test suites effectively
- Understand and implement spies and stubs for testing
- Implement hooks in your test suite
- Conduct unit testing with Async functions
- Write integration tests with a small Node server

## Requirements

- All of your code will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 using Node 12.x.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the `.js` extension
- When running every test with `npm run test *.test.js`, everything should pass correctly without any warning or error

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on specific concepts of unit testing in JavaScript. Here's an overview of the tasks:

1. **Basic test with Mocha and Node assertion library**: Learn how to set up Mocha and use the Node assertion library for testing.

2. **Combining descriptions**: Upgrade the previous task by adding more complexity to your test cases and descriptions.

3. **Spies**: Explore the use of spies in testing using the Sinon library.

4. **Stubs**: Understand how to use stubs in testing to control specific behaviors.

5. **Hooks**: Learn how to use hooks to execute functions before or after tests.

6. **Async tests with done**: Dive into testing asynchronous functions using the `done` callback.

7. **Skip**: Learn how to skip tests to deal with breaking scenarios temporarily.

8. **Basic Integration testing**: Get introduced to integration testing using Express and Mocha.

9. **Regex integration testing**: Extend your integration testing knowledge to handle dynamic routes using regular expressions.

10. **Deep equality & Post integration testing**: Explore deep equality and practice post integration testing.
